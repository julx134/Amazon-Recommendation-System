##Item-Based Collobarative-Filtering
Collaborative Filtering (CF) produces recommendations by evaluating the ratings of items by users.<br/>
1) Pre-process datasets to remove incosistencies and type errors
2) Create the user-item matrix
3) Employ a similarity algorithm such as cosine and Pearson to find features/similarities between items
4) Find the top Kth nearest neighbours for an item using weighted averages of items similar to the items the user has rated
